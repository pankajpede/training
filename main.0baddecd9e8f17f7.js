In this session, we learn the basics of UI/UX philosophy, and the difference between them, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing. We will also be discussing what the UX process is, what is a prototype, an example of user testing, tools that will be used for this purpose, UI concepts, and a lot more. All of this will help you form a framework that will help you build the career of your choice and bring you to appreciate this under-appreciated practice.
